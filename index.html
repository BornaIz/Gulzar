							Gulzar: a contemporary Urdu Nasta’liq typeface
						</h2>
						<h5>Borna Izadpanah</h5>
						<p lang="en">
							This project began at the end of 2019 when I was commissioned by
							Google to design an original Urdu Nasta’liq typeface. Since it was
							beyond my capabilities to embark on this task independently, Fiona
							Ross and Simon Cozens were invited to join the project as
							consultant and font engineer respectively. The Latin typeface was
							designed by Alice Savoie as a harmonious counterpart to the
							Nasta'liq. The background and design process is described below.

						</figure>
						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>
							The first phase of this project involved conducting research into
							the history of Urdu digital typefaces from the early 1980s. This
							built on research already conducted for an MA dissertation at the
							University of Reading,
							<i>The typographic development of the Nasta’liq style</i>, by
							Borna Izadpanah (2015). This work included the analysis of some of
							the early and noteworthy Urdu Nastaliq digital typeface projects,
							including Monotype’s <i>Noori Nastaliq</i> (1981), by Ahmed Mirza
							Jamil and Monotype Corporation; Linotype’s <i>Sheeraz</i> (1986-7)
							and <i>Qalmi</i> (1994), by Mike Fellows, Tim Holloway and Fiona
							Ross; <i>DecoType Nastaliq</i> (2010) and
							<i>Nastaleeq Press</i> (2013), by Thomas Milo and Mirjam Somers.
							Each of these pioneering typefaces offered solutions for
							typesetting with Urdu Nasta’liq; however, since none of these
							typefaces were originally developed as an OpenType font, their
							application required the use of specifically designed software,
							and largely remained limited to particular technological
							environments.
						</p>
						<p>
							More recently a number of OpenType Nasta’liq typefaces have been
							designed in Iran, Pakistan and Europe which have made valuable
							advances in Nasta’liq typography. Some of the notable examples
							include Iran Nastaliq designed by Hossein Zahedi following the
							calligraphy of Amir Ahmad Falsafi (2007–08); Noto Nastaliq Urdu by
							Patrick Giasson and Kamal Mansour (2014); Mehr Nastaliq Web by
							Muhammad Zeeshan Nasar following the calligraphy of Nasrullah Mehr
							(2017).
						</p>
						<h3>The design</h3>
						<p>
							The design of Gulzar was inspired by carefully collected specimens
							of Urdu calligraphy and lettering which were closely studied to
							achieve an accurate representation of the Urdu flavour of the
							Nasta’liq style (Fig 2).
						</p>
						<figure class="figure mx-auto">
							<img
								src="images/persian-urdu.jpg"
								class="figure-img img-fluid rounded"
							/>
							<figcaption class="figure-caption">
								Fig 2. Note the structural differences between the Persian (top)
								and Urdu (bottom) flavours of the Nasta’liq style.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							The models however were not merely traced and digitised, but they
							were used as an inspiration to design a typeface with a
							contemporary feel. Thus Gulzar was designed typographically rather
							than calligraphically. This is particularly evident in the
							treatment of terminals which were designed to look clear and
							consistent on different platforms and in different sizes (Fig 3).
						</p>
						<figure class="figure mx-auto">
							<img
								src="images/terminals.jpeg"
								class="figure-img img-fluid rounded"
							/>
							<figcaption class="figure-caption">
								Fig 3. Note the sharply cut terminals.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							After collecting the most suitable models for the letterforms,
							Amir Mahdi Moslehi, an Iranian designer and calligrapher, was
							asked to produce initial calligraphic patterns which would ensure
							the consistency of the stroke modulation that is crucial to
							Nasta’liq. In this style, calligraphers use different sections of
							the nib of the reed pen and frequently rotate the pen to shape the
							Nasta’liq letterforms (Fig 4). This is carefully controlled to
							produce the balance of the letterforms and the distribution of the
							thick and thin strokes.
						</p>
						<figure class="figure mx-auto">
							<img
								src="images/angle.jpeg"
								class="figure-img img-fluid rounded"
							/>
							<figcaption class="figure-caption">
								Fig 4. This illustration shows the angle of the reed pen in
								writing different parts of each letterform.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							The first sketches that Amir provided were not satisfactory since
							they clearly showed the Persian calligraphic sensibilities which
							were not in accordance with the collected Urdu models. The
							important and distinctive characteristics of the Urdu models were
							indicated to Amir, and based on this brief, he produced patterns
							that were much more consistent with the provided models. However,
							it became apparent that there were still important characteristics
							of Urdu Nasta’liq which were not correctly implemented, and thus
							only a few of these new patterns, with some alteration, were
							adopted. The design process therefore necessitated several rounds
							of drawing of almost every glyph in Gulzar, until it reached the
							desired quality in digital form. In this process, each version was
							extensively tested and reviewed to ensure the quality of the
							design.

						</figure>
						<p>
							One of the most challenging aspects in the design process of
							Gulzar was to devise the character set (glyphset) required to
							produce a fully functioning Nastaliq typeface. Initially this was
							inspired by the approach that was conceived by Mike Fellows, Tim
							Holloway and Fiona Ross in designing the Linotype Sheeraz and
							Qalmi typefaces. These were the first Nasta’liq fonts that
							provided a method in which the letters were stored in their
							individual forms and composed calligraphically with dots and
							diacritics in their correct positions. In this system, the letters
							were broken down into a relatively modest number of forms or
							characters which were administered by the rules of calligraphy
							programmed into the software. Therefore, unlike Monotype’s Noori
							Nastaliq, which was limited to the groups of letters existing in
							Urdu language, almost any letter combination could be achieved by
							this approach. Moreover, by designating their “zones of
							influence”, dots and diacritics could alter their positions to
							avoid clashes through specific software techniques. This was
							especially important for the <i>baṛī ye</i> character which occurs
							frequently in Urdu text. This ability was essential to newspaper
							typesetting, which often uses foreign words and names that the
							font should be able to render.

								Fig 6. The method of connecting characters and dot positioning

							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							In Sheeraz and Qalmi, each undotted letter (called rasm in Arabic)
							consisted of a group of initial, medial, final and unconnected
							variants and alternatives. Most of the connecting forms, such as
							those displayed in Fig 6, were designed with entry and exit
							strokes which would overlap to make the cursive connection. This
							was further modified in Gulzar; instead of adding both entry and
							exit strokes, each character has only an exit stroke, specifically
							designed to match the character following it (Fig 7). Thanks to
							this approach, the initial forms of letter groups could also be
							re-used as components in the medial position. This not only
							reduced the number of glyphs which needed to be designed, but also
							ensured smooth and seamless connections.

							<figcaption class="figure-caption">
								Fig 7. The method of connecting characters in Sheeraz and Qalmi
								typefaces (left) and in Gulzar (right).
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							In Nasta’liq style, depending on the size and application,
							calligraphers make various modifications in the proportions and
							stroke thicknesses to achieve the best optical rendition of the
							letterforms. In a digital typeface, which is supposed to function
							at different sizes and on different printed or digital platforms,
							this quality is much more difficult to implement. Ideally a font
							would include a number of optical axes designed to ensure the
							delivery of the best effect in different sizes. In Gulzar, the aim
							has been to produce a typeface which is legible at text sizes and
							suitable for sustained reading. Therefore, loops and apertures are
							designed more open to ensure clarity in small sizes.
						</p>
						<h3>Latin counterpart</h3>
						<p>
							The Latin counterpart was conceived in coherence with Gulzar’s
							underlying principles, i.e. a typeface that is rooted in a
							traditional calligraphic structure but expresses a contemporary
							feel with a sharp treatment of details; and a typeface that can
							perform at text sizes for sustained reading. Once the Nasta’liq
							design was firmly established, a proposal was made for a Latin
							counterpart that took inspiration from two eminent humanistic
							references: the versatile and sturdy proportions of Robert
							Granjon’s types, coupled with the sharp and distinctive feel of
							Hendrik van den Keere’s work. The Latin letterforms thus feature
							some subtle references to their calligraphic roots and echo the
							contrast present in the Nasta’liq, while remaining embedded in
							their classical typographic proportions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Particular attention has been given to the proportions, weight and
							contrast of the Latin so that it sets harmoniously with the
							Nasta’liq. Defining the most appropriate vertical proportions, in
							particular, was a crucial aspect of pairing both scripts and
							making sure that they belonged together.
						</p>
						<p>
							Gulzar is not the first OpenType Nasta’liq typeface, but it is the
							first Nasta’liq type for which an original Latin counterpart was
							designed. It covers all the required transliterations characters
							to transcribe Arabic, Persian and Urdu languages.

						<h3>Next Steps</h3>
						<p>
							Some contextual alternates are already implemented in the font and
							can be manually implemented by the users. Examples are <i>kaf</i>,
							<i>gaf</i>, <i>be</i>, <i>te</i>, <i>fe</i> and <i>sin</i>, and
							some elongated forms are also provided. However, at this stage
							elongation (<i>kashida</i> or <i>tatweel</i>) is not supported,
							but it can be incorporated in future releases. (See
							<a href="https://github.com/simoncozens/Gulzar/issues/45"
								>tracking issue</a
							>.)

								Fig 9. Various contextual alternates and elongated forms in
								Gulzar.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							Other potential expansions of the project will include an optical
							size axis and a bold style to provide a better text hierarchy
							where required. Currently, Gulzar fully supports Arabic, Persian
							and Urdu languages and, hopefully, future updates will include
							wider support for other languages which use the Arabic script.
						</p>
						<p>
							This project's aim is to contribute to a better representation of
							Arabic-script writing styles across different platforms. It is not
							only a new typeface but offers a novel approach in designing
							typefaces that are designed to accurately represent the script
							rules and push the boundaries of current text rendering
							technologies. Since this is an open source project, we encourage
							other designers and font-makers to adopt this method to create
							more typefaces based on their preferred stylistic expressions. We
							hope that this will be a turning point in designing Arabic-script
							typefaces which are not limited by Latin-script-oriented
							typesetting technologies, but which promote a more inclusive and
							diverse approach in typeface design.
						</p>
						<h3>Engineering of Gulzar</h3>
						<p>
							Engineering a Nastal’iq font with OpenType technology was a huge
							challenge. The first stages involved understanding the scope of
							the problem and examining existing approaches, notably that of
							Noto Nastaliq Urdu, as well as the patent documenting the
							technology behind Linotype Qalmi. But while we adopted some
							elements from both of these projects - Qalmi’s system of
							contextual substitution, and Noto’s decomposition of characters
							into <i>rasm</i> and <i>nukte</i> - ultimately we needed to
							develop many of our own techniques.
						</p>
						<p>
							Indeed, the Gulzar project birthed a number of new technologies,
							without which it would not have been possible to achieve the
							result we wanted: first, the
							<a
								class="text-secondary"
								href="https://fez.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
								>FEZ language</a
							>
							was created as a more flexible and programmable alternative to
							Adobe’s feature language; the
							<a
								class="text-secondary"
								href="http://corvelsoftware.co.uk/crowbar/"
								>Crowbar</a
							>
							OpenType debugger was invaluable in tracing the complex
							interactions between layout rules; a new collision detection
							library,
							<a
								class="text-secondary"
								href="https://github.com/simoncozens/collidoscope"
								>Collidoscope</a
							>, was written to help inform the dot positioning algorithm; and a
							<a
								class="text-secondary"
								href="https://simoncozens.github.io/tdd-for-otl/"
								>new font QA approach</a
							>
							based on test-driven design was developed to ensure that
							development did not cause regressions to desired behaviour.
						</p>
						<p>
							With contextual glyph substitution and decomposition in place, the
							major engineering requirements of a Nastal’iq design are the
							correct placement of dots; achieving tight but even fitting; and
							the special handling of certain characters which impact upon text
							to their right (particular <i>baṛī ye</i>, but also final
							<i>jim</i>, <i>ain</i>, and <i>choti ye</i>).
						</p>
						<p>
							In Gulzar, <i>dot placement</i> and fitting are intertwined; dots
							are first placed using mark positioning as normal, but special
							consideration is given to the interaction between the final
							character in one sequence and the initial character of the next
							sequence at a particular height, with a set of contextual rules
							determining the correct placement of dots at these interactions.
							(See red arrows in figure 10.) Finally, an exhaustive search is
							used to determine situations where dots in their natural placement
							would collide, and in these situations the dots are moved to
							second or third alternate anchor positions. (See green arrow.)

							<i>Tight fitting</i> is achieved through an
							<a
								class="text-secondary"
								href="https://simoncozens.github.io/nastaliq-autokerning/"
								>automated approach</a
							>
							which determines the correct spacing between the final character
							of a sequence and the initial character of the next, with
							reference to the “height” of the following sequence.

						</figure>
						<p>
							<i>Special handling</i> of <i>baṛī ye</i> and other sequences was
							achieved through a combination of techniques: substituting mark
							glyphs affected by the <i>baṛī ye</i> swash by unanchored variants
							allows them to be removed from the normal positioning system, and
							then a similar collision avoidance algorithm to that described
							above is applied to identify sequences which need to be
							repositioned (fig 12); for other glyphs which have smaller
							rightward strokes that only affect a single previous glyph,
							contextual positioning rules achieved the same objective.

							<figcaption class="figure-caption">
								Fig 12. Handling the <i>baṛī ye</i> sequence
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							Overall, the combination of these techniques provides a tighter
							fitting and more natural layout than other Nastal’iq OpenType
							fonts, at the cost of considerable technological complexity - at
							many points during the development of the font, the font refused
							to compile due to the large number of contextual rules! However,
							we found ways to compact the layout in order to provide both a
							performant and aesthetically pleasing result.
						</p>
						<p>
							As an open source project which we hope will be a basis for others
							to develop their own fonts, we have made it a priority to document
							and explain Gulzar’s engineering processes; you can read more of
							the technical details behind how the engineering works in

						<h3 id="issues">Reporting issues</h3>
						<p>
							Although a substantial amount of work has gone into producing the
							best possible result when typesetting with Gulzar and avoiding
							clashes, at this point in time it is extremely difficult to
							produce an OpenType Nasta’liq typeface that can automatically
							anticipate every possible letter combination and render them
							correctly. Therefore, there might be instances where certain
							sequences are not correctly displayed. In this case, we invite
							users to report such issues or any other problem that they may
							encounter on GitHub, and we will do our best to address them. We
							are aware of the lack of proper support for typefaces like Gulzar
							on platforms such as Adobe InDesign and Illustrator. However, the
							latest version of Photoshop (thanks to the implementation of
							HarfBuzz) correctly displays Gulzar, and we believe that other
							Adobe applications will soon follow suit. (See
							<a href="https://github.com/simoncozens/Gulzar/issues/39"
								>tracking issue</a
							>.)
