  # The Glyphs file will contain a set of information about selecting
  # connecting glyphs (what the Qalmi patent calls the Generic Selection
  # Table). Code in the Makefile will extract this information from the
  # Glyphs file and into a CSV file (rules.csv). The custom NastaliqConnections
  # plugin reads this CSV file and creates a set of reverse chaining
  # single substitution rules. It also defines the glyph class
  # @reachable_glyphs, which contains all the glyphs which are actually
  # *used* by the rules. (So if you create a JIMm12 but no connection
  # rule ever substitutes it in, we don't need to care about it.)
